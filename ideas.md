* Needs to be simpler, less material.
* More R help?
* Perhaps use the ess package for some assignments?
* Less use of Faraway for exercises?
* More data analysis in class?
* Use visreg more, and drop car package? Or use mgcviz?

* Weeks 1-2 on linear models -- more time on leverage, influence, Cook's distance, residual analysis
* Weeks 3-6 on GLM -- slow down, more time on each type of response
* Weeks 7-9 on GLMM -- Same length of time as 2017, but more on interpretation
* Weeks 10-12 on GAM -- Drop loess, smoothing splines, just do regression splines and penalized regression splines. Drop MARS. Finish on GAMM.
*
* Spend each lecture introducing one idea, and then illustrating it.
* Exercise should be focused on implementing same ideas on different data sets.
* What to do with people who don't know R, or don't know tidyverse/ggplot2?
* More time on understanding interactions using plots
* Check out margins and prediction packages from Thomas Leeper. Simplify interface considerably.

 * Start with discussion of sample space of response, nature of predictors (numeric, categorical, random), relationship between response and predictors (interactions, linearity)
 * More on interactions, data analysis interpretation, etc., in first week or two
 * Add likelihood derivations
 * Only use lm, glm, gam and gamm for fitting models??
 * Use visreg for model plotting from the beginning and drop carplots? -- will this replace both termplot and crPlots?
 * More time discussing residual plots for linear models, incl partial residual plots.
 * More on F and Chi-square tests and when to use which one
 * Perhaps create etc3580 package which loads mgcv, lmer, faraway, tidyverse, ...
 * Drop orthogonal poly??
 * Add robust regression and robust GLM?


Add qgam and mgcviz?
